This program is intended to assist Dungeon master in managing NPC's stats.

The program is currently only available on windows, and compiles well with:
VS2010,
VS2008,
Sharpdev,
 and MonoDevelop (.net compile only. Not compatable for a mono build)


This app is pretty self explanatory but feel free to e-mail me with questions. 
I wrote it for the Weekly Dnd group. I originally carried multiples of this sheet with me to games just to keep track of NPC and heros.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, thoughts, opinions, suggestions, or bug reports.  I always welcome feedback from users, be it good, bad, or ugly.

Please submit issues to [here](https://github.com/darkwisperer/Dungeon-Master-Sheet)  if possible, if not then email me.

Features:

  ability modifiers are automaticaly set.
